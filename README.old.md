# React Calculator

## Instructions
In this initial commit you have been provided a blank repo.

Your task is to create an interactive React Calculator page that responds to user input.

## Expectations
- Use create-react-app in your terminal to build the project
- Create a component that has the title of your calculator.
- Create another component that contains your input boxes and error message.
- Your calculator component should check if the inputs can be parsed as numbers, and if not, it should display an error message.
- Import these components into the App.js to display appropriately.
- Style your calculator with CSS.
- *Extra Credit Goal: Research what React Props are, and make one component that can be used for your numberOne, numberTwo, and answer input boxes. You can pass the data into these components using props.  See here: https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html*
